** Column descriptions

1. The spectral-element naming convention is as follows for both the
   UVIS and IR channels. All filter names begin with F, and grisms
   with G; if the filter is part of a four-element quad mosaic, a Q
   follows F. Then there is a three-digit number giving the nominal
   effective wavelength of the bandpass, in nm (UVIS channel) or nm/10
   (IR channel). (For long-pass filters, the number is instead the
   nominal blue cut-off wavelength in nm.) Finally, for the filters,
   one or two letters indicate the bandpass width: X (extremely wide),
   LP (long pass), W (wide), M (medium), or N (narrow).

2. Filters intended for imaging in a red-shifted bandpass are given
   descriptions similar to the following: “z (Hα + [N II])”.

3. “Pivot wavelength” is a measure of the effective wavelength of a
   filter (see Section 9.3 and Tokunaga & Vacca 2005, PASP, 117,
   421). It is calculated here based on the integrated system
   throughput. Filter transmissions were measured in air, but the
   equivalent vacuum wavelengths are reported in this table.

4. Widths listed are passband rectangular width, defined as the
   equivalent width divided by the maximum throughput within the
   filter bandpass. Equivalent width is the integral with respect to
   wavelength of the throughput across the filter passband.


* The [N II] temperature map

The main issue here is the correction for the underlying continuum. 

+ In the Ring Nebula EW(Hb) = 800 Angstrom and is roughly constant in the inner region (drops at the outside, where dust scattering becomes important)
+ In Orion, the EW is smaller: roughly 400 Angstrom in the inner regions, but varying strongly with position
+ From O'Dell & Harris we have spectrophotometry
  + The relevant regions ase the  portions of slits 11 and 12
    + 



** Factors affecting the 5755/6584 determination

*** Spatial variations in the continuum color

+ Bob's =k= term
  + Defined as 
: flux ratio of the continuum (in wavelength intervals) at the line filter wavelength and at 547 nm


**** Fig 2 of O'Dell & Harris
+ The spectrum rises towards the blue, even though it is not de-reddened
+ The E sample (EW=190) is bluer than the 12-mid sample (EW=430)
+ Between 547 and 575 there is not much difference
+ I measure at most 0.06 dex for 12-mid
  + Corresponds to a ratio of k = 10**-0.06 = 0.87
  + So even this is significantly different from unity



**** Evidence from the 469/547 ratio
+ The 469 filter is potentially contaminated by [Fe III] 4701.53 and He I 4713.139, so we have to be careful
  + Baldwin has fluxes as follows
    | lambda(obs) | lambda_0 | Ion      | delta V | FWHM |  I/6678 | Icorr/6678 |     S/N | Notes   |
    |-------------+----------+----------+---------+------+---------+------------+---------+---------|
    |    4701.603 |  4701.53 | [Fe III] |     4.6 |   14 |  0.0390 |     0.0559 |   188.8 |         |
    |    4713.164 | 4713.139 | He I     |     1.5 |   19 |  0.1340 |     0.1916 |   354.3 | average |
    |    4861.334 |  4861.33 | H\beta   |     0.2 |   26 | 17.4964 |    24.2016 | 62680.0 |         | 
    So, assuming HB EW is 400, we get EWs for the two lines of 400 [0.0559, 0.1916]/24.2016 = [0.924, 3.167] Angstroms
  + The filter width is 


    
  + Bob estimates (in Ring paper, penultimate para of appendix) that up to 10% of the 469 signal may be from lines (principally He I).
  + In principle, this could be corrected for if we had observations of another He line.... we don't
  + On the other hand, to zeroth order the He I will follow H I, which in turn follows the Paschen continuum
  + This means that /variations/ in 469/$OTHER_FILTER are unlikely to be due to the He I line
  + The [Fe III] 
+ But apart from that, it should be telling us the continuum color
+ It shows peak-to-peak variations of about 20% in the "interesting" (NW) zone, and about 10% in the more boring (SE) zone
+ It seems to be correlated with the 469/487 ratio, which is the reciprocal of the EW of Hb (modulo contamination of FQ469N)
  + This is what we expect, since the continuum color should be bluer in regions where the scattered continuum is higher
  + 469/487 shows peak-to-peak variations of order 50% in the NW zone, and 20% in the SE zone
+ We should check this against the EW determined from the 487/547 ratio too.
