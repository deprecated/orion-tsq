Orion t^2 project based on Rubin's 2012 WFC3 data

* Messing around with the graphics
Abandoned both of these for the time being - more trouble than they were worth. 
** Fancy javascript effects

* Notes on particular objects

** Shadows 
There are at least three sorts of shadows: 
1. Observer shadows, such as foreground disks and clouds
   + Where we are in the shadow of the object
2. Shadow rays behind proplyds
   + These are low ionization: increase in [N II]/H\alpha and decrease in [O III]/H\beta
   + They are seen in the outer part of the field
3. Shadow holes
   + The prototype is the Dark Arc
   + They are /high/ ionization




* Learning to use a proper database
+ The main thing I want from a database is the ability to simultaneously update records from multiple programs running at the same time, without having
+ However, after spending an entire morning looking into this, it seems to be far more trouble than it is worth
  + Doing it properly, e.g., using SQLalchemy is way too complicated
  + There are easy-to-use wrappers such as dataset, but they are very limiting
    + You can't store nested dicts or dicts of numpy arrays very easily
    + Although you can do it by doing =json.dumps= on the sub-objects to convert them to a string
  + It is also necessary to be careful with concurrent connections, although I think I have that just about sorted
    + With SQLite, many processes can be reading from the database at any one time, but only one can be writing to it
* Final push to finish this - April 2014
We have a lot of material that needs to be drawn together
** Applying the final calibrations of the WFC3 filters
+ For F658N/F547M, the original calibration seems to be right
+ For FQ575N/F547M, the best fit seems to be r0 = 1.1, q1 = 1.1
  + But what is actually changing there?
*** TODO [0/5] Absolute calibration of the filters
+ A simpler approach would be to simply integrate the spectra over the nominal filter bandwidth and compare this with the WFC3 images
+ This would have the disadvantage that it is depends on a combination of the filter width and peak transmission, but on the other hand the r0 and q1 etc also have this problem
+ Also, we have the problem that some filters wavebands have coverage gaps in the Adal and Manu datasets - only F547M really
+ So we actually don't need any of the line fitting at all
**** TODO Absolute fluxes from ODH spectra
+ This should be even easier
+ Although I had to go back to the FITS files to extract the spectra
**** TODO Absolute fluxes from Ring spectra
**** TODO Absolute fluxes from Adal spectra
**** TODO Absolute fluxes from Manu spectra
+ Calculated by [[file:manu-fold-filters.py][file:~/Work/RubinWFC3/Tsquared/manu-fold-filters.py]]

** Redoing the spatial scale calculation
* Recombination line temperatures and densities
From the Manu spectra we can measure various useful ratios:
+ O II 4649/(4639+51+62) is density sensitive
  + We have it in the blue and green spectra but the green spectra are
    not so good
  + We have fitted the lines by assuming common velocity and width of all lines in the multiplet, and also that the 4639, 4651, 4662 components have a equal intensities.
    + This is somewhat justified by the very similar density dependences of those 3 lines, so long as the density is not too low (see Fig 6 of Fang & Liu 2013MNRAS.429.2791F).
+ O II Sum(V1)/[O III] 4959 is temperature sensitive
  + There are actually 8 lines in the V1 multiplet in total.  The four that we use for the density plus:
    + 4642, which we measure and is quite strong - theoretically it is about 22% of the total multiplet intensity with almost no density dependence above 1e3 pcc
      + However, it is blended with an N III line, which we would need to control for
    + 4676, which we measure but is weaker - 8% of the multiplet theoretically, again with almost no density dependence
    + 4674 and 4696 are very weak and we do not attempt to fit them.  But they add up to less than 2% of the total multiplet.
  + So there would be two possible approaches:
    1. Just use 4649+39+51+62 and then correct for the missing 4 components by dividing by (1 - 0.22 - 0.08 - 0.02) = 0.68 to get the total V1 intensity.
    2. Also add 4642 and 4676 and divide by (1 - 0.02) = 0.98 to get the total
       + But in this case we need to check for contamination of the 4642 line.  We could look at the histogram of 4642/(4639+51+62), which ought to be constant at about 0.22/0.68 = 0.32
       + Also with 4676 line we should maybe add in 4674 since it is probably blended.  So the expected ratio of (4674+4676)/(4639+51+62) is (0.08 + 0.02)/0.68 = 0.15
+ O II 4649/4591 is temperature sensitive
  + 4591 comes from a different multiplet - V15 supposedly
    + Fang calls them
      + M1 2p23p 4Do – 2p23s 4P λ4652
      + M48a 4f G[5,4,3]o – 3d 4 F λ4089
      + M15 3p′ 2Fo – 3s′ 2D has 4591
        + Supposedly the upper level is 6.76 eV below the ionization threshold
  + There is a graph in Fang 2013a Fig 21 upper.
    + Note that it is a *log scale* of 4649/4591
    + Typical value from our observations is log10(ratio) = 0.8 \pm 0.2, which implies log T = 3.65 \pm 0.25, which is (3000, 4500, 8000) K
    + To get > 8000 K require log10(ratio) < 0.6, which means 4591 > 1/4 4649
      + Very few of our positions have such strong 4591 lines
      + Looking at the fits to 4591, it seems that many have failed
      + Just taking ones that look like good fits, we get 4649/4591 ratios of 4.6, 10.3, 8.9, 9.9, 11.6 -> log(R) = 0.96 +/- 0.06, which means an even lower T
      + However, in some of the better quality spectra (e.g., blue-0226-0196) there is slight evidence for an underlying absorption line.  This indicates that 4649 may be under-estimated
      + This can be best investigating by looking at the spectra with low EW(H gamma)
        + For instance, blue-0382-0641 shows faint absorption on the blue side of all the He I lines.  Even here, it is hard to say there is any absorption at 4649 but probably there is. 
  + In summary we are probably on a hiding to nothing with this line.  Maybe we could order all the regions by 4363 ratio, split them into 4 parts and look at the average spectrum of each quartile to see if there is any variation in 4649/4591
    + Actually, it doesn't look so bad.  There is also the 4189 line from the V36 multiplet.  This and its companion 4185 lne are clearly detected.  There are no other lines to blend with them, although 4189 is actually two lines: 4189.79 + 4189.59.  The He II 4200 absorption line is nearby but does ot interfere with it.
    + 4649/4189 and 4649/4591 have almost identical dependences on T, falling with rising T.  They need to be about as low as 4 for "normal" temperatures of 8000 K.  The observed values of around 10 imply much lower T (4000 K or so)
    + 4649/4089 on the other hand should increase with increasing T.  The nominal observed value in Orion is 6.2, which actually implies temperatures > 1e4 K.  For 8000 K we expect a ratio of 3.7 (Fang & Liu 2013 Fig 17)
    + However, as Peimbert & Peimbert (2013) point out, this ignores the Si IV line at 4088.86, which has two effects:
      + Emission, being about 50% of the strength of the O II 4089.29 line
      + Underlying absorption: Simón-Díaz et al (2006) show the Si IV absorption in the wing of the H\delta line, with the following absorption depths:
        + th1C (O7V): 0.1
        + th1A and th1D (B0.5V): 0.2
        + th2A (O9V): 0.1
      + The He II 4200, 4541 lines that are seen in absorption show depths in the Orion spectra of about 3-4%, which is 4-5 times less that that seen in th1C.
      + If there were similar dilution of the Si IV feature, then this would be about a 2% absorption with a width of about 2 Angstrom.  EW ~= 0.04 \AA
      + But there may be less dilution since the later-type OB stars will contribute more than in the case of the He II lines.  Say that the continuum is 50% atomic, 25% th1C and 25% th1A/D, then the absorption will be 7%, with an EW of 0.15 \AA
      + But in that case, the high-resolution Esteban spectra should show a broad absorption trough with a narrower emission line
      + The 4089.29 emission line should have an EW of about -0.1 \AA
      + For comparison, the 4649 line has an EW of about -0.5 \AA
  + Try to find quantitative data on the lines from Storey (1994).  These are effective recombination coefficients in units of (1e-14 cm^{3} s^{-1}) for the whole multiplet as a function of T, and for n = 1e4

  + So there is a difference of 5% between Case A/B but almost no dependence on density.
  + This is the data from NIST on the 4591 and 4649 line.

  + So the core electrons are in a different ang mom state for the 4591 line.
    + This seems to be referred to as the *parentage*: most lines are .^{3}P but 4591 is .^{1}D
    + According to Sec 4.2 of Storey (1994), it is low-temperature dielectronic recombination that populates the .^{1}D and .^{1}S parentages.  He says it is very small, and doesn't show results for any lines, claiming that they all have \alpha_{eff} < 1e-14 cm^{3} s^{-1}
    + Note that the 4650 multiplet has a total recombination coefficient of about 4.4e-13 @ 7500 K, of which the 4649 line represents about 35% at a density of 1e4 pcc
  + Measurements from Figure of Fang & Liu for ratio, combined with data from Storey (1994) for V1:

  + So it looks like the 4591 line intensity is relatively insensitive to T
  + Dielectronic recombination rates:
    + Nusbaumer et al use an equation of the form:
    + 1e-12 [(a/t) + b + c t + d t^{2}] \times t^{-3/2} \times e^{-f/t } cm^{3} s^{-1}
    + Where t = T/1e4 K

** Manu spectra
+ [X] manu-photom.py - we will fit only those fibers that are within the box of the WFC3 data
  + 60 x 60 arcsec box centered on 5:35:13.592, -5:24:11.04
  + th1C has coords of 5:35:16.452 -5:23:22.97 
    | 5@35'13.592" | 5@35'16.452" | 0@ 0' 42.736752" |
    | -5@24'11.04" | -5@23'22.97" | 0@ 0' 48.07"     |
    #+TBLFM: @1$3=15 cos(5) ($2 - $1)::@2$3=$2 - $1
  + So this puts the box center at (-43, -48) in arcsec
  + This is running, but is going to take all day
+ [X] Need to refactor - split into three parts:
  1. [X] Extract the spectra I need 
     - save a seperate JSON db for each section
  2. [X] Perform the Gaussian fits 
     - save fit parameters separately for each section, and in different files from the actual spectra
     - have flexible mechanism for doing/redoing particular sections and particular wavranges
     - tie together the wavelengths of lines of the same ion/multiplet
       - for instance, O II lines of the V1 multiplet
  3. [X] Produce the figures
+ [X] manu-calibration.py
  + Use the circular apertures of each fiber (2.69 arcsec diameter)
+ [X] process-orion-spectra-by-filter.py manu
  + Before we can do this, we need to do one of two things:
    1. Consolidate all the litle files into a big database, as we had before
    2. Change the program to use folders instead of one big database
  + [X] Option 1 would be simpler: manu-photom-consolidate.py
  + [X] And run the program

+ [X] Do the plots
  + 
*** Using the filesystem as a poor-man's database
+ Tha main concern is to allow multiple processes to be working on the line-fitting, either on the same machine or different machines
+ So we can use separate files for saving the fit parameters of each line for each position
+ Change to using =Positions= instead of =Sections=
  + =Manu-Data/Positions/blue-0140-0262.json= has the data written by =manu-photom-select.py=, which includes the arrays of wavelengths, fluxes, etc.
  + =Manu-Data/LineFit/blue-0140-0262/5299.json= has the fit data for the line 5299 

** ODH spectra
+ [X] odh-photom.py - this fits Gaussians to all the spectra in the three slit
+ [X] odh-calibration.py - this extracts the slit apertures from the WFC3 images 
+ [X] process-odh-spectra-by-filter.py - this reorganizes the spectra data to write a table for each filter, with all the necessary information.
+ [X] orion_compare_filters.py

** Comparison of my method with Bob's method
Start with the NII line ratio.

*** My way
+ EW = [(169/k) (575/547) - 4.7] / 0.26
+ 169/4.7 = 35.96
+ In A6.2 of Ring Paper I, Bob recommends multiplying this by 1.4
  + This gives 1.4 35.96 = 50.344
  + Looks like 1.2 might be a better number
    + This will give us a mean T more similar to Adal's values
*** Bob's way
+ Correction term
  + 1 + (50.44 k^{}^{-1} 575/547 - 1)^{-1}
  + k = 0.9356 according to Bob - compares very well with my 0.938
+ From 575, 658, 547 to observed rnii
  + term575 = 53.91 575/547
  + term658 = 26.08 658/547

*** Table of fluxes for relevant slits
+ The 9-east slit does not actually overlap
+ The 10-mid and 11-mid slits do, but they extend a long way to the east as well
+ The "record" column is from Bob's notes on his comparison with the ODH spectra
  + presumably, this is for a custom portion of the slit in the overlap region

To see all available configurables, use `--help-all`

Examples
--------

    The simplest way to use nbconvert is
    
    > ipython nbconvert mynotebook.ipynb
    
    which will convert mynotebook.ipynb to the default format (probably HTML).
    
    You can specify the export format with `--to`.
    Options include ['custom', 'html', 'latex', 'markdown', 'python', 'rst', 'slides']
    
    > ipython nbconvert --to latex mynotebook.ipnynb
    
    Both HTML and LaTeX support multiple output templates. LaTeX includes
    'basic', 'book', and 'article'.  HTML includes 'basic' and 'full'.  You 
    can specify the flavor of the format used.
    
    > ipython nbconvert --to html --template basic mynotebook.ipynb
    
    You can also pipe the output to stdout, rather than a file
    
    > ipython nbconvert mynotebook.ipynb --stdout
    
    A post-processor can be used to compile a PDF
    
    > ipython nbconvert mynotebook.ipynb --to latex --post PDF
    
    You can get (and serve) a Reveal.js-powered slideshow
    
    > ipython nbconvert myslides.ipynb --to slides --post serve
    
    Multiple notebooks can be given at the command line in a couple of 
    different ways:
    
    > ipython nbconvert notebook*.ipynb
    > ipython nbconvert notebook1.ipynb notebook2.ipynb
    
    or you can specify the notebooks list in a config file, containing::
    
        c.NbConvertApp.notebooks = ["my_notebook.ipynb"]
    
    > ipython nbconvert --config mycfg.py

** Interference patterns in the maps
+ The Hb/ha ratio has obvious interference patterns.  These have peak-to--peak amplitudes of about 5% in the worst cases.
** Modelling the variation in the 575/658 ratio
+ A large part will be caused by continuum, so should be correlated with 547/575
*** Simple line plus continuum model
+ F547M = Cont W547 T547
+ FQ575N = (Color Cont W575 + Line) T575
+ Where:
  + F... is the filter signal
  + W... is the width
    + W575 = 20.6
    + W547 = 650.0
  + T... is the peak throughput
    + T575 = 0.23
    + T547 = 0.26
  + Color is the 575/547 continuum ratio (\approx 0.938)
  + Cont, Line = continuum and line intensities
+ If we substitute for Cont, then
  + FQ575N = (Color F547M W575 /  (W547 T547) + Line) T575
  + FQ575N = (a F547M + Line) T575
  + Where a = Color W575 / W547 T547 =  0.938 20.6 / 0.26 650.0 = 0.114336094675

** DONE Recheck the EW of Orion and Ring Nebula
CLOSED: [2013-12-21 Sat 11:26]
+ [[file:EW(%5BN%20II%5D%205755).ipynb][This ipython notebook]] has the calculations
+ Bottom line is 3 \AA EW for [N II] 5755 \AA in Orion
+ But that is for far-out regions.  In the Rubin slit we have 5 to 15 \AA
+ And 100 \AA in the Ring Nebula
** DONE Use Bally STIS slit for better estimate of color term
CLOSED: [2014-01-09 Thu 10:03]
+ Pixel scale is 2.746 \AA
+ Each line is about 100 \AA wide due to 2 arcsec slit
*** Conclusions from Bally HST10 slit spectrum
1. The 575/547 color correction is found to be 0.938, which is consistent within the errors with the value of 0.93 found from the Rubin spectrum
2. The "true" spatial variation (that is, corrected for noise, see below) in the color correction (for this slit) is about 0.5% RMS and occurs on scales of >= 100 pixels, or 5 arcsec
   + Since the WFC3 images may sample a wider range of conditions than the STIS slit, there may be larger variation there
3. The 469/547 color correction is 1.29 +/- 0.03 (pure continuum), or 1.36 +/- 0.03 (full He I + [Fe III] line contribution).  The actual case with the WFC3 F469N filter will lie between these two extremes.  The "true" variation in either case is about 2.7% RMS, but there is only a small correlation between the 469/547 and 575/547 continuum ratios: slope \(-0.09\) with \(R^{2 }< 17\%\).
   + As a result, it is probably not worth trying use 469/547 to estimate 575/547, since even in the absence of noise, all we could achieve would be to reduce the RMS from 0.5% to 0.45%.  /And/ we would be adding more noise, which is not good.
4. The "noise" (as measured by the variance between two narrow adjacent continuum bands) does not fall quite as steep as \(N^{{-1}}\).  We need to be aware of this when we try and noise-subtract the variance profiles.  This should not be such an issue with the images, since \(N\) increases quadratically with scale, instead of just linearly as it does with the spectra.
   + This is not so surprising, since it is only shot noise that falls as \(1/N\).  Read noise, dark current, flat-field variations, interference patterns, etc can all contribute to the noise and will behave differently.
   + [ ] We do have independent estimates of these for WFC3 from the studies of flats that I did for the Ring project - need to dig those up.  Although that was with white light so it wouldn't catch any interference fringes that appear with certain emission lines.
   + Cosmic rays also contribute to noise (since the CR removal is never perfect), and in a highly non-gaussian way.  

*** Lines that we can see in the G430L spectrum
+ NOT [N II] 5755
  + Unfortunately, this is just off the red side of the spectrum
+ [Cl III] 5518,38
  + Both of roughly equal strength
+ [Fe III] 5270
+ [N I] 5198,200
+ Other weak lines blending together
+ Overlap (very strong)
  + H\beta 4861
  + [O III] 4959
  + [O III] 5007
+ Overlap (similar strength)
  + He I 4713
  + [Fe III] 4658
  + The F469N (53.1 \AA) filter is 4662.25 \to 4715.35
    + So the lines are at the edges of the filters
    + We need to take into account that the filters are given in vacuum wavelengths
+ Overlap
  + He I 4471 (roughly 4 x stronger than 4363)
  + He I 4388 (2 \to 3 times weaker than 4363)
    + a tiny perturbation to 4471
  + H\gamma 4340 + [O III] 4363
    + The 4363 line can be seen as a slight bump on the blue side of the 4471 line
    + Also as a similar bump on 4340, but harder to see since 4340 is brighter
+ Overlap

+ We find a color correction of 0.93 in [[file:Rubin%20STIS%20spectra.ipynb][this ipynb file]]
  + There is no evidence that it varies with EW
  + On the other hand, there is the slight worry that the STIS spectra do not cover the entire spectral range of F547M
    + F547M has \lambda_{0} = 5447 \AA and \Delta\lambda = 650 \AA, so 5122 \to 5772 \AA
    + The STIS spectra go from 5448 upwards, so the bluemost extent is the center of the band
    + We are missing the short wavelength half of its bandpass (5122 \to 5448), which has 30% higher transmission than the long wavelength half that we have (5448 \to 5772)

*** Mail that I sent [2013-12-20 Fri]
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
A little later than promised due to family commitments, but I have managed to get some work done on this project.  I decided to go back to the beginning and make sure I was getting the fundamentals right.  So I have been checking the value of the Equivalent Width of [N II] 5755 from various datasets that I have lying around (Keck and STIS).  I also have calculated it for the Ring Nebula from the SPM B&Ch spectra. 

The bottom line is that for multiple positions in Orion, EW(5755) = 3 Angstrom.  Whereas in the main ring of the Ring Nebula, EW(5755) = 100 Angstrom.  These should be compared with the nominal width of the FQ575N filter of WFC3, which is 20.6 Angstrom.

What this means is that our Ring Nebula paper is safe because the continuum contamination of the [N II] auroral line filter is small (~ 20%).  In Orion, on the other hand, the FQ575N filter is dominated by continuum, which is 6 times stronger than the emission line that we want to measure.

This means that if we want to know the [N II] line intensity to a precision of (say) 10%, then we need to know the continuum to a precision of better than 2%. 

So, what I plan on doing next is to check how precisely we can estimate the continuum around 5755 Ang using the filters we have: F547M and F469N.  I plan to do this by comparison with STIS spectra that Bob Rubin obtained many years ago (published in 2003MNRAS.340..362R - Gary is a coauthor).  One of his slit positions overlaps our WFC3 Orion S field and includes the ranges 4308-4594, 4818-5104, and 5448-6020.  So the spectra cover half of the F547M bandpass and they straddle the F469N bandpass but unfortunately do not include it.  Therefore, they should be fine for looking at spatial variations in the continuum color, but will not help us in estimating the line contamination of F469N. 

Of course, the same spectra will also allow a direct comparison of the 5755 intensity with our WFC3 measurements where they overlap, and I think this is worth doing too.

+ Main aim is to assess whether we can measure t^2([N II]) or not.
+ First task is to accurately measure the 5755/6584 ratio
  + The main problem is that the 5755 line only contributes about 10% to the FQ575N filter.  The remainder is continuum.  So that continuum needs to be measured and subtracted very accurately.
  + Secondary problem is extinction
+ Second task is to find T([N II]) and t^2 from the 5755/6584 ratio
  + Bob has some of the complications described in [[file:record]]
  + Circular dependence of reddening on T via intrinsic Hb/Ha ratio
  + Dependence of T(N II) on density:
    + t(NII)=2.5/{longRNII - 2.108 + [1 + 4.4E-5Ne/t^1/2]}
    + Density varies from 1000 to 6000 cm^{-3}

+ Strangely, this is consistently higher by about 0.3 with respect to the previous maps, such as O'Dell & Yusef-Zadeh (2000)

* The [N II] temperature map

The main issue here is the correction for the underlying continuum. 

+ In the Ring Nebula EW(Hb) = 800 Angstrom and is roughly constant in the inner region (drops at the outside, where dust scattering becomes important)
+ In Orion, the EW is smaller: roughly 400 Angstrom in the inner regions, but varying strongly with position
+ From O'Dell & Harris we have spectrophotometry
  + The relevant regions are the western portions of slits 11 and 12

** Factors affecting the 5755/6584 determination

*** Spatial variations in the continuum color

+ Bob's =k= term
  + Defined as 
: flux ratio of the continuum (in wavelength intervals) at the line
: filter wavelength and at 547 nm


**** Fig 2 of O'Dell & Harris
+ The spectrum rises towards the blue, even though it is not de-reddened
+ The E sample (EW=190) is bluer than the 12-mid sample (EW=430)
+ Between 547 and 575 there is only a small difference
  + I measure about 0.06 dex for 12-mid
    + Corresponds to a ratio of k = 10**-0.06 = 0.87
    + So even this is significantly different from unity
  + This will have a potentially large effect since EW(5755) is small
+ Between 547 and 658 the difference is a bit larger



**** Evidence from the 469/547 ratio
+ The 469 filter is potentially contaminated by [Fe III] 4701.53 and He I 4713.139, so we have to be careful
  + Baldwin has fluxes as follows
    | lambda(obs) | lambda_0 | Ion      | delta V | FWHM |  I/6678 | Icorr/6678 |     S/N | Notes   |
    |-------------+----------+----------+---------+------+---------+------------+---------+---------|
    |    4701.603 |  4701.53 | [Fe III] |     4.6 |   14 |  0.0390 |     0.0559 |   188.8 |         |
    |    4713.164 | 4713.139 | He I     |     1.5 |   19 |  0.1340 |     0.1916 |   354.3 | average |
    |    4861.334 |  4861.33 | H\beta   |     0.2 |   26 | 17.4964 |    24.2016 | 62680.0 |         |
  + So, assuming H beta EW is 400 Angstrom, we get EWs for the two lines of 400 [0.0559, 0.1916]/24.2016 = [0.924, 3.167] Angstroms
  + The filter width is 53.1 Angstrom according to Bob
    + In addition, the He I line falls on the red flank of the filter, where the transmission is about 0.12, which is 0.6 times the peak
    + Although it will be very sensitive to the heliocentric correction since we are on a very steep part of the transmission curve.
  + So the fractional contribution of the He I line should be 0.6 3.167 / 53.1 = 0.0358 => only about 3.5%
  + The [Fe III] line has a transmission of 0.19 = 0.95 times peak, giving a fractional contribution of 0.95 0.924 / 53.1 = 0.016, which is 1.6%
  + So, in *normal* circumstances the line contamination of F469N should be about 5% when EW(Hb) = 400 Angstrom
    + And would be even less when the EW(Hb) is lower
  + An exception will be from shocked regions that have much enhanced [Fe III] emission
    + For example HH202 from Mesa Delgado et al (2012)
      + The nebular component has flux 0.237 on scale Hb=100 (similar to Baldwin)
      + The shock component has flux 3.915 on scale Hb=100
	+ For Hb:
	  + shock = (6.00±0.20) ×10−12 erg cm−2 s−1
	  + nebula = (3.80±0.20)×10−12 erg cm−2 s−1
	+ So, if we did not resolve the 2 components we would get
	  + 100 I([Fe III]) / I(Hb) =  (6.00 3.915 + 3.80 0.237)/(6.00 + 3.80) = 2.49
	  + So if EW(Hb) = 400, we would have EW([Fe III]) = 400 2.49 / 100 = 9.96
      + So fractional contribution of shocked [Fe III] to F469N is 0.95 9.96 / 53.1 = 0.178
	+ => nearly 20%
    + We can compare this with the excess in 469/547 seen at the position of the HH529 counterflow, which is about 10%
      + So this is not quite as extreme as in HH202, possible because the shock component is not as strong relative to the nebular component
  + Bob estimates (in Ring paper, penultimate para of appendix) that up to 10% of the 469 signal may be from lines (principally He I).
    + I get only half this value (/see above/) 
  + In principle, this could be corrected for if we had observations of another He line.... we don't
  + On the other hand, to zeroth order the He I will follow H I, which in turn follows the Paschen continuum
  + This means that /variations/ in 469/547 are unlikely to be due to the He I line
    + Except for enhanced [Fe III] emission from shocks, which is seen in two or three very localised regions
  + But apart from that, it should be telling us the continuum color
  + It shows peak-to-peak variations of about 20% in the "interesting" (NW) zone, and about 10% in the more boring (SE) zone
  + The ratio 469/547 is /negatively/ correlated with 487/547, which is to first order the EW of Hb
    + That is, the continuum is bluer when EW(Hb) is lower
    + This is what we expect, since the continuum color should be bluer in regions where the scattered continuum is higher
    + It is the /opposite/ of what one would expect if line contamination of 469 were a serious issue
      + Since in that case, the line contamination should be relatively higher when there is less continuum to dilute it
      + Which implies 469/547 should go up when 487/547 goes up, which is not observed.
    + 487/547 shows peak-to-peak variations of order 50% in the NW zone, and 20% in the SE zone

+ Total line strength is about 1 x that of the reference line (is that H\beta?)
  + We need to be careful with double counting, since many lines are observed in both the red and the blue arm
  + No, it is 6678 and H\beta has 24.2016, so we have a total of about 4% of H\beta
  + So the total EW(lines) is about 16 \AA for EW(H\beta) = 400 \AA
  + The filter width is 650 \AA, so line contamination is 2.5%

*** Just the filters we use

Bob says in the Ring paper...

: We adopted the pre-launch determined values of W from Table 6.2 of the
: WFC3 Instrument Handbook, except increasing the values slightly
: because of the broadening due to short wavelength shift of the filter
: profile. The amount of the shift was guided by the determination from
: emission-lines falling on the short wavelength portion of the filter
: profile described below. The adopted values of W were FQ436N (4.5 nm),
: FQ437N (3.3 nm), F469N (5.31 nm), F487N (6.2 nm), FQ575N (2.06 nm),
: FQ672N (2.21 nm), F673N (12.31 nm), and FQ674N (2.11 nm). It was not
: necessary to adopt a value of W for F502N, F656N, and F658N because
: the observed continuum was so weak that the continuum correction was
: less than 0.01).

+ For the most part, the transmission profiles are very square, but F547M has a significant slope: from 0.26 at 525 nm to 0.19 at 580 nm.
  + This does not affect the nominal width, which is EW/peak
  + But it means that there will be a color term in the filter sensitivity
  + Variation is about 20%


**** Notes to the table columns

Columns 1-4 are described below. 

6 - EW is Width times Peak Throughput (in Angstroms for a change).

7 - EW normalised to the F547M filter

8 - Same as previous, but for the nominal widths instead

*** Column descriptions

1. The spectral-element naming convention is as follows for both the
   UVIS and IR channels. All filter names begin with F, and grisms
   with G; if the filter is part of a four-element quad mosaic, a Q
   follows F. Then there is a three-digit number giving the nominal
   effective wavelength of the bandpass, in nm (UVIS channel) or nm/10
   (IR channel). (For long-pass filters, the number is instead the
   nominal blue cut-off wavelength in nm.) Finally, for the filters,
   one or two letters indicate the bandpass width: X (extremely wide),
   LP (long pass), W (wide), M (medium), or N (narrow).

2. Filters intended for imaging in a red-shifted bandpass are given
   descriptions similar to the following: “z (Hα + [N II])”.

3. “Pivot wavelength” is a measure of the effective wavelength of a
   filter (see Section 9.3 and Tokunaga & Vacca 2005, PASP, 117,
   421). It is calculated here based on the integrated system
   throughput. Filter transmissions were measured in air, but the
   equivalent vacuum wavelengths are reported in this table.

4. Widths listed are passband rectangular width, defined as the
   equivalent width divided by the maximum throughput within the
   filter bandpass. Equivalent width is the integral with respect to
   wavelength of the throughput across the filter passband.
